# dig-out
A simple DNS Stub Resolver in C.

###Have you ever just wanted to take a URL, send it out to a recursive resolver, and find out which IP the URL resolves to? 
... if so you're in luck!

Dig Out is a relatively dumb DNS stub resolver provided here as proof that the internet is not, in fact, magic; it's 
just a way to grab data from another computer!

So at the end of the day, Dig Out handles CNAME and A Records. 

That's it. 

I don't owe you more than that.
